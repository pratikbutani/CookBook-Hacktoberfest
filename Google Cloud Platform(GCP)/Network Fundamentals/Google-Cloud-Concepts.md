# What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing basically refers to accessing and storing data over the Internet instead of doing it on your personal hard drive.
It offers services like storage, database, networking, and moreover the Internet to provide faster, innovative, and flexible resources to its customers. 
The customers get to pay only for the resources they use, hence helping them lower their operating costs and run their business infrastructure more efficiently.
Now, among various cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft, VMWare, IBM, etc., 
Google Cloud has been the talk of the town in recent years and there are enough reasons behind it. 



# What Is Google Cloud Platform?

Google Cloud is a suite of Cloud Computing services offered by Google. 
The platform provides various services like compute, storage, networking, Big Data, and many more that run on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end users like Google Search and YouTube.
Google server hasn’t gone down in years. So, if you are planning to run your application on the Google Cloud infrastructure, then you can be assured of your applications being safe and secure.

# Google Cloud Platform Pros and Cons :- 


## GCP Pros

1. Each service in the GCP has its own use case and was designed to work specifically with the next service and their well-defined rules of engagement.
   The GCP documentation is unparalleled when it comes to strengths. Everyone loves how Google incorporates the actions into GCP’s documents. 
   It’s divided into an overview section, followed by a hands-on section, and guides the reader through the implementation of the feature or service.
   
2. GCP’s global backbone network uses advanced software-defined networking and edge-caching services for fast, scalable, and consistent performance delivery. 
   Despite the premium-tier global network being a bit expensive, the ability to design architectures using a virtual private cloud (VPC) automatically routing traffic on a global network is definitely worth the investment.
   
   
## GCP Cons

1. Google Cloud Platform offers far fewer services than those by its leading competitors viz. AWS and Azure.

2. GCP’s opinionated model on how their cloud services should be used is only catering to software developers.
